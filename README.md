This repository contains a couple of summary's web layouts.
My first project is **WebDew**.In my opinion this project was useful because I took experince creating slide show in JavaScript.

**Relvise** helped me to see how I should to parse, research lauout before to start work, which way to work. Here I have taken acquaintance with __methology BEM__. Some explonations doesn't work in my project, so solving problems my way I was trying to follow BEM. I have made some changes in folders orderliness as well. I believe this will contribute readeble's work.
